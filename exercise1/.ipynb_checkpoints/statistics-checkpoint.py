### Statistics
Have a look at the ```scipy.stats``` [module](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html)

#### a. Create a discrete random variable with poissonian distribution and plot its probability mass function (PMF), cummulative distribution function (CDF) and a histogram of 1000 random realizations of the variable

#### b. Create a continious random variable with normal distribution and plot its probability mass function (PMF), cummulative distribution function (CDF) and a histogram of 1000 random realizations of the variable

#### c. Test if two sets of (independent) random data comes from the same distribution
Hint: Have a look at the ```ttest_ind``` function
